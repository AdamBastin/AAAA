# This is Adam's Amazing AD Actions
I created this Powershell script as a first time, big project. As such, there are many ways this can be improved. The main reason I am uploading is to show my progress in future work, but I am uploading in case someone else can find anything useful in here.

This script is a UI tool for common tasks I have come across working as a network admin. This script is broken into 7 sections, delimited by tabs which I will show below.

Here are the tools included:
1. [Unlock User](#unlock-user)
2. Create New User
3. Copy Groups
4. Folder Permissions
5. User Migration
6. Remote Map Drive
7. [LAPS Password](#laps-password)
